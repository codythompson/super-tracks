# TODO NOTES

## pathing

- Track graph needs a method that will return a new tile coordinate given a speed (non directional) and a desired turn (left, right, or none)
  - will path toward desired exit (ignores desired turn if only one exit)

## drawable

- Figure out the best way to deal with custom rotations/offsets/handles per image in a tileset (support commented out case in DbgObjs.rogue)

## Screen

- change GameState from extending a state to extendinga screen
